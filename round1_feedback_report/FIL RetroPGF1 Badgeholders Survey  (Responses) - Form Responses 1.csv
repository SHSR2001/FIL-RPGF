6/13/2024 1:05:15,2,I think the broad mission was positive and made sense. I like the focus on identifying gap between received and generated value.,"* Was not always clear who got funds, or that funds would be used to retroactively reward work versus to support future work.   More of a curated experience of badge holder diligence - e.g. getting some volunteers to do their work in public and share so people could get examples of what things to look for and judge on might be useful.",3,8,"a couple different csv's / google sheets got shared, but there wasn't much shared between badge holders. getting some volunteers to proactively do some research work - e.g. how much funding projects have received already - would be potentially useful in helping seed a more collaborative badge holder experience",3,4,,2,,4,Seems like a lot of process for the amount of funds distributed,
6/13/2024 2:44:14,3,"Having this new mechanism in the Filecoin community is definitely the most positive thing! It's good to award public goods such as protocol R&D, infra and similar.","It wasn't clear what is part of FF/PL. Also, things like ""lotus dependencies"" are a cheat.",3,"maybe 8 in total, but throughout many days (I would prefer to take more focused approach)",Manual for badgeholders was first shared but than most important information was shared later (on the call). I had to wait until the last day to make sure I have all information really as info kept coming and it was hard to stay up to date.,4,4,"Would be nice to be able to change your vote, if deadline didn't pass yet.
I wish voting was transparent but anonymous. I am not sure I can trust the results this way.",4,Funding that many have received was unclear. Especially teams that are or were part of PL. It was weird to nominate projects when people there received salaries for building it and were probably not the original creators.,5,"Thank you for setting this up! I hope we can even start thinking about new things, rather than just taking recreating another OP model and process.","Would definitely love to fix applications first. More clarity there and instructions would be great. 

Distribution was very flat which meant not much difference for high impact projects."
6/13/2024 4:25:12,3,"The scope of eligible projects was reasonably clear. The scope of appropriate retroactive funding (i.e. the funding delta) was, and still is, extremely murky and feels like a classic rationalist attempt at manufactured rigour. ",,4,4,The workload was fine. Browsing the projects was reasonably easy. ,4,3,"The empty spreadsheet that was shared definitely helped with filling in the votes, vs. having to submit 100 forms. I don't think the tool itself is particularly helpful, but the csv import function is.",4,"I think most projects were good. Some I already knew quite well, others less so. I don't think more information would help, other than a very concrete ""how does your project concretely relate to Filecoin?"", which you'd expect people would communicate in the impact questions, but not always. I found the ""previous funding"" data useless. The metrics were largely useless too, maybe intrinsically or maybe because of format. This is fundamentally a qualitative exercise, and trying to dress is as quantitative is unhelpful.",4,"I was among the coldest badgeholders, largely on account of the instructions and in recognition of the fact that I can't accurately assess the veracity of previous funding, the total value delivered, and the delta between the two. I could have pretended, of course, but what's the point. I would be way more likely to participate again if I were just told to pick 10 projects that I think deserve a reward. I posit that the overall result of having badgeholders freely apply their own value metric while being limited to a smaller number of projects would result in a much more interesting reward distribution.","The whole debacle around 0 votes was an hilarious exercise in misunderstanding of the concept of a distribution. The issue of whether a 0 vote should count towards quorum, which everyone seems fixated on, is a distraction; people thinking any vote (or nonvote) can a priori be neutral towards a project is the real tragedy."
6/17/2024 19:40:32,2,"The mechanism and explanation of the Bagholder roles and votes (total number of votes for each bagholders, maximum votes for each project).","The comment section in https://www.fil-retropgf.io/ was not working. There isn't a way for bagholder to put in comment so the project representative could answer the questions/query from bagholders. This should be available in future rounds, which the questions and response could be view by public. This allow greater transparency and due diligence review by community as well.",5,8 hours,"Although there is metric impact, it is still time consuming for bagholders to verify and check. For future to lessen the workload for bagholders, probably has 2nd round of review by community governance or community group on the information posted by the project. ",3,3,,4,,5,The valuable experience was been able to gain insight from other bagholder perspective on review the project and discussion about PGF. Each and every bagholder has their own value in regards to PGF. This has been great experience to know each bagholder.,
